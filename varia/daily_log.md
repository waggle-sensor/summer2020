## July 3 (holiday) + weekend
- Coded SVM for our problem
- Tried SVM on the data
- Coded neural network for our problem
- Applied a simple neural network on the data
- Shuffled the data multiple times to make it more representative
- Error analysis for the SVM and neural network
 
# Week 4:
 
## July 6:
