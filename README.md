## Summer 2020: 

Hello and welcome! This is a space to keep your daily blogs and maintain a 
README with links to resources that may be shared using non-Git avenues. Please 
create a folder named per your lastname. If you need to create documents, spreadsheets 
and share them, feel free to create a folder named per your lastname in our shared [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17ORwX3BePohe8QSMuhbCwRIuqeW_5eGo)
and link to your GitHub files. 

[Here](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/summer2018/tree/master/morrison) is an 
example of a student space organization. Please follow it in organizing your 
space.
