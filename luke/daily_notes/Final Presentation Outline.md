- Use cases and explanation of goal in segmentation
- Initial Approach
  - Computer-aided labeling
  - After researching the literature around water segmentation, I directed my effort to fully-automated water segmentation
- Problems that need to be solved to segment water
  - Water features can take on a wide variety of colors, textures, and can move in a wide variety of ways
  - Neural nets have to balance accuracy and speed
    - Water detection is a tricky problem, especially when looking at water images from a variety of sources, so this requires more parameters and more complexity added to the neural nets
    - More complexity means lower speed
- Methods for segmentation
  - Color-based descriptors (single-image)
    - Most puddles, when viewed from a perspective with a high angle of incidence, appear smooth and shiny
    - Difficulty: lighting conditions vary tremendously and this rule-of-thumb ratio does not always apply
  - Texture-based descriptors (single-image)
    - Supplements color to provide more cues from one image
    - Difficulty: the classifier must include water that contains choppy waves, smooth puddles, and puddles on asphalt which look grainy
  - Temporal descriptors (video-based)
    - My favorite, most creative but also most computationally-expensive
    - Looks at the intensity of 3x3 patches of video for a certain amount of time, apply the FFT to the graph of the intensity over time, and use those signals to classify the periodic motion of water
- Future work
  - Unifying these specialized algorithms to produce one general-purpose water segmentation algorithm 
  - Implementing these algorithms on specific edge devices
    - Sage project uses Nvidia NX in nodes
