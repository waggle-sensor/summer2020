- Researching color and motion frequencies in video for the purpose of detecting water based off its specific reflection/refraction/movement properties

  - MIT CSAIL researchers were able to accentuate details in videos that fall within a specific frequency domain, and this would be very helpful when dealing with water since water moves in rivers at a specific rate and its surface responds to rain droplets falling at a specific frequency
  - One alternative application to this is that if we know with confidence where in a video there exists water, we can analyze the frequencies of motion emit visually by that puddle to gauge the rate of rainfall

-   ```
  Crop constants for copying: 835, 430, 280, 214
  ```
  
- I was successful at applying FFT to the video per-pixel over time. It yielded positive results around the areas of lit-up puddles, and most of the highest frequencies were observed around those areas.

  - A sample around the puddles

    ```
    Around: [1290, 1590, 585, 913, 1150] 
    In the center: [20.2, 1, 88.5]
    ```
