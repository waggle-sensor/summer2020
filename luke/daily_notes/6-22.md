- Trying out different metrics that can be used to judge whether a picture has water or not
- Determined empirically that using the foreground detection does not effect the accuracy of the algorithm by very much at all
- Researching linear classifiers and PCA to find a way to pull together a bunch of metrics (entropy, gradient sum, variance in color across the field) to have the algorithm make a very well-educated final decision about whether a frame likely contains water or not
