1. - Foreground feature detection flowed nicely into the water detection
2. - A naive approach
   - Counting contiguous blobs could work better
     - Faster
     - Current method sufficient 
3. - Boosting technique for increased accuracy
4. - Water is relevant to life in Chicago
     - No one wants to drive through standing water
     - Big problem: how to segment water
       - Determine volume and the time to absorb
5. - Continued with a metrics-based approach
