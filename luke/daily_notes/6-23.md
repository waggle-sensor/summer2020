# 6/23

- Working on a command line interface for my Python script to bin images
- I trained a Support Vector Machine with a few metrics I computed from the images, and yesterday I was very successful with training it, getting a test accuracy of about 90%! Now it appears that was mostly due to overfitting, and most of this day has been spent deducing how to **standardize** the metrics I have been gathering so that they don't depend on the specific crop dimensions.
- Once I find a way to develop a standard model that can filter out images, I will be in a good place.
