# 6/23

- Working on a command line interface for my Python script to bin images
- I trained a Support Vector Machine with a few metrics I computed from the images, and yesterday I was very successful with training it, getting a test accuracy of about 90%! Now it appears that was mostly due to overfitting, and most of this day has been spent deducing how to **standardize** the metrics I have been gathering so that they don't depend on the specific crop dimensions.
- Once I find a way to develop a standard model that can filter out images, I will be in a good place.



This is a quick statistics output I compiled:

```
------ Metric (0) ------
Dist 0 | Mean: 1.993044, Max: 2.777546, Min: 1.290230
Dist 1 | Mean: 1.970540, Max: 2.914791, Min: 0.883854
Dist 2 | Mean: 1.470363, Max: 2.169831, Min: 0.811956
------ Metric (1) ------
Dist 0 | Mean: 35.296829, Max: 53.216376, Min: 21.667023
Dist 1 | Mean: 33.439714, Max: 54.730217, Min: 17.683495
Dist 2 | Mean: 25.167401, Max: 46.427409, Min: 15.172504
------ Metric (2) ------
Dist 0 | Mean: 8503268.539976, Max: 17054282.512646, Min: 2705468.040265
Dist 1 | Mean: 8310737.597869, Max: 17163732.355144, Min: 1870584.469890
Dist 2 | Mean: 13781714.960346, Max: 24703805.727013, Min: 3075456.277925
------ Metric (3) ------
Dist 0 | Mean: 78.925591, Max: 156.808295, Min: 25.266860
Dist 1 | Mean: 77.486892, Max: 160.284698, Min: 17.518633
Dist 2 | Mean: 74.858056, Max: 133.963122, Min: 16.738545
------ Metric (4) ------
Dist 0 | Mean: 1.721092, Max: 2.761608, Min: 0.648868
Dist 1 | Mean: 1.747633, Max: 2.807831, Min: 0.429965
Dist 2 | Mean: 1.225374, Max: 2.003619, Min: 0.455193
```

It shows me that the third distribution I am pulling from (the unclassified distribution, also dist. 2) is much different metric-wise than the other two. This shows that I need to standardize these metrics in some way.
