- Quantified results of accuracy vs sampling framerate for the texture-temporal classifier

  ```
  [TEST] lbp texture
  	Median Error: 0.450000
  	Mean Error: 0.457745
  [TEST] lbp texture
  	Median Error: 0.320000
  	Mean Error: 0.376443
  [TEST] lbp texture
  	Median Error: 0.170000
  	Mean Error: 0.215461
  ```

The following image shows 5 columns, the first being the original grayscale image, and the last 4 being the output of texture-temporal classifiers trained with a sampling rate of 1, 5, 10, and 30 fps, respectively, over 2 seconds. You can observe that the tt classifier is able to cut through the noise quite well with more features.
