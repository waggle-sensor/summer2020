# 7/1

- Continue work on water detection, now currently looking at 30fps video to see if disruptions of puddles emit some sort of visual frequency that could be useful to detect puddles in the future

- To test this theory I am going to find the average FFT output of three sections of the video.

  1. A puddle and the area around it

     ```
     433, 245, 70, 50 - circular puddle
     262, 182, 70, 50 - longer puddle
     ```

  2. Another region with motion in it

     ```
     537, 86, 70, 50 - blinking sign
     75, 58, 70, 50  - traffic light
     ```

  3. A region with no motion in it

     ```
     354, 182, 70, 50 - intersection asphalt with no puddle
     ```

- The program did not give me the results I expected. I am investigating why there is not a significant spike in the DFT output when looking at the visual changes of a blinking sign, since I know for a fact that the sign is blinking every 50frames/sec, so I should see a corresponding spike in the DFT output.
