- Continuing research into the literature of not just water detection, but any kind of motion detecting using FFT. There are a lot of problems within the topic of puddle detection that have been solved, but there could be more applications of FFT in video that have not been explored yet, so I am going to explore those.

- I could run an experiment where I look at sub-boxes of videos showcasing various motions, ex. leaves rustling and puddle disruptions, and pipe that input into an SVM
  - Develop a system of importing videos of any length without overloading my desktop's RAM
  - Import and attach the masks I made for each video to the TrainingVideo object that I will structure
  - Divide each video into subblocks of dimension 3x3 and a duration of 5 seconds (150 frames at 30fps)
  - Tag each subblock with the correct label, at the moment either leaf or water
  - Group the subblocks with the same label together, visualize the distributions of DFT signals, and pass it into an SVM to figure out if it can identify each subblock by the DFT output alone 
- Program Model
  - TrainingVideo
    - Input a training video in the form of a video file or a folder of images, having the option to load it into RAM immediately or wait to load it a frame at a time
    - Attach a video-long spatial mask to the video after the video has loaded, assigning a classification to each pixel, either water or non-water at the moment
  - Training and Classification
    - For training, I will take as many videos of water and other kinds of dynamic textures as possible and build a classifier (SVM or Random Forest) to classify between those kinds of motion, specifically picking out and interpreting the FFT quality of water.
      - For each training video I will take each pixel marked as water (by the mask I will draw on the video) and flatten those into an array of: `(# of water pixel samples, a specified discrete FFT duration)`. By "water pixel samples" I mean the signal produced by a water pixel for the course of some specified time period.
