# 7/9

- Problems to solve today
  - Sage Workshop (2 hours)
  - Curate an official or unofficial (my own curation) dataset of water-masked videos to allow me to visualize the over-arching patterns of water motion
  - Test the best classification method with the FFT output that can classify between leaf-motion and water-motion (and other motion?)
  - Discuss with Raj and Nicola the best direction for my research
    - How much of my time should I spend on trying to fit an algorithm to automatically segment the images I have from the AoT nodes and how much time should I spend on researching paper ideas? Or is that entirely up to me?
      - Trying to balance implementation with abstract research
    - I am wondering what problem fields to investigate, preferrably related to water detection, that are open enough that I could do new work within them
      - Invested a lot of time into learning about FFT
      - Would like paper to use Sage data or produce something useful to Sage
      - Puddles seem to be taken
