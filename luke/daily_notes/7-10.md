# 7/10

- Problems to solve today
  - Build a robust dataset for video-based water detection
    - Collect images and videos preferably at 30-fps
    - (Part of my optimization can be looking at the best accuracy vs. frame rate, so collecting 30-fps videos would be optimal, since I can sample at any number of frame rates for those videos)
  - Implement as many water-detection algorithms as possible
