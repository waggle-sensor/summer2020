## Code history
Currently, my smoke detection work builds off of previous work done at UCSD and the SDSC; my work relies on much of the pipeline and environment setup code from authors at these institutions.

I am developing a novel approach to deep learning-based smoke detection, which is my primary contribution to this work. All model-related code is my own, unless otherwise specified (the original model used is preserved for comparison). 

The original repository from UCSD (currently being developed): [ar-noc/keras-smoke-detection](https://gitlab.nautilus.optiputer.net/ar-noc/keras-smoke-detection/-/tree/master)

The SDSC fork of the original repository: [i3perez/keras-smoke-detection](https://gitlab.nautilus.optiputer.net/i3perez/keras-smoke-detection/-/tree/master)

My smoke detection work is a fork of the SDSC fork, with both the SDSC repo and the UCSD repo set as remote repositories so changes can be pulled into my fork at any time. In order to preserve the git history and remote repositories, I had to create a separate repository from this one.
