Sample Code Notes

PyImageSearch
    1. Uses YOLO for person detection
    2. Only videos
    3. Does not do any camera calibration or image transformation, only calculates pixel 	distance between centroids of bounding boxes, not accurate far from camera
    4. Does not account for groups of people walking together
